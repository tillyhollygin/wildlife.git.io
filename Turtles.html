	Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle, and even the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. </br>
	Charities work on sea turtles focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback and olive ridley.</br>
    Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered.</br>
	Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. It alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. </br>
